## Obtaining Credentials

To be able to use this connector you need the to provide your **personal access token**. To do so, you first
need to log into your GitHub account at [https://github.com](https://github.com/). Then you have to
follow [GitHub's official documentation on how to obtain your personal access token](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token)
.

:::caution

If you set your personal access key valid for only 7 days, then the connector will be able to load the data from GitHub
for only 7 days too.

:::

Lastly you have to give your personal access token all read/view permissions. Such that the connector can actually read
the data.
