## Obtaining Credentials

To be able to use Clockify's API, you need to obtain the **API key** and the **base endpoint**. To do so you need to
have Clockify already set up. You can do so by simply heading over to [https://clockify.me](https://clockify.me) and
creating an account if you don't already have one. Then you need to log in with your email and password.

:::note

If you have a self-hosted Clockify instance, then your URL will look different.

### API key

After you have logged in you can obtain your **API key**. You can do so by first clicking on your icon in the top
right of your window, then selecting `Profile Settings` and lastly scrolling to the end of the page. On the bottom
you will see now your API key. These two steps are visualized by the next two images.

the API key in the respective connectors too.
