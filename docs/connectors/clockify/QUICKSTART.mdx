# Quickstart

In this quickstart you will setup DataLbry's Clockify Connector.

## Dependencies

You will need the following dependencies to run the code and develop:

- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)
- [Java 11](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/)
- [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/)
- [Gradle](https://gradle.org/)
- [Clockify User Account](https://clockify.me/)

## Obtaining the code

You can obtain the code simply with Git. The Clockify connector is on GitHub. So you can go to your desired directory
and execute the following command to download the code with git.

```
$ git clone git@github.com:datalbry/clockify-connector.git
```

## Obtaining Credentials

To be able to use Clockify's API, you need to obtain the credentials and the base endpoint.

To obtain the API key, simply head to your user settings in the web frontend and scroll to the bottom of the page. The
API Base Endpoint depends on your setup.

If you don't have a self hosted clockify instance, then your endpoint is `https:/api.clockify.me/api/v1`.
If you have a self hosted clockify instance, then your endpoint is `https://yourcustomdomain.com/api`.clockify
For more information please check out: [https://clockify.me/developers-api](https://clockify.me/developers-api)

Now that you have obtained the credentials you need to add them to your gradle properties. We don't want to store them
in the project properties because it can happen that they leak into the git repository making them effectively public.
Instead, insert them into your gradle properties at ~/.gradle/gradle.properties

```sh
datalbry.clockify.apiKey = <yourApiKey>
datalbry.clockify.uri = <yourEndpoint>
```

## Download the dependencies

If you are using an IDE like IntelliJ IDEA then you probably don't need this part but if you are using the Gradle CLI
then you can download the dependencies with gradle `./gradlew build`.


## Testing

The tests are only working for DataLbry's test instance. If you don't have access to it (via the api key) then your
tests will fail. All integration tests should be written against the test instance.
