# Connector Documentation

The documentation below contains information on how to write a connector. It provides a sample REST API, which will be
used to provide hands-on examples, so each and every step can be comprehended locally on your machine.

First, we are going through the requirements and setting up the REST API on your local system. Afterwards we will
continue with documentation, which is divided into the following parts:

1. Terminology
2. The target API
3. Create a derivation graph
4. Create a Client
5. Create a connector

## Requirements

Initially you should make sure you have the following installed:

- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)
- [Java 11](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/)
- [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/)
- [Gradle](https://gradle.org/)

Additionally, you need to clone the following three repositories:

- [Sample API](https://github.com/datalbry/sample-api)
- [Sample API Client](https://github.com/datalbry/sample-api-client)
- [Sample API Connector](https://github.com/datalbry/sample-api-connector)

## Setup

Next we want to set up the three projects you previously pulled.

### Sample API

First, you need to build the OCI image locally using Docker. To achieve this simply run the following command from within the project directory

```shell
$ docker build -t sample-api .
$ docker run -p 8000:8000 sample-api
```

The API should instantly become ready on http://127.0.0.1:8000. You can easily verify it by visiting
http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs. If everything went well, the FastAPI Swagger UI should become available.

### Sample API Client and Sample API Connector

These two projects use gradle with the `idea` plugin. So you can easily import them with IntelliJ by using `./gradle
openIdea`

### Importing the projects

The projects are managed by gradle. Additionally, they make use of the `idea` plugin. This makes it easy for you to
import it with IntelliJ. You just need to import the project with Gradle as the build system.

## Terminology

<dfn>System</dfn>: A system can be anything that provides data. For example a system could be:

- REST/SOAP endpoint
- a file like a CSV
- a database

<dfn>Derivation Graph</dfn>: A derivation graph in this context is a graph structure, which defines the transitions from
objects. A transition means that with information from the parent you can retrieve the child from the target system.

<dfn>Connector</dfn>: A connector is a collection of processors which build the transitions on the derivation graph of
the system

## The target API

We have provided a small example Toy API for this documentation. You can explore it
on [http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs](http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs). The API has been kept simple on purpose.

In the end you should see, that there are in total 5 entities

- `Person`
- `Computer`
- `Project`
- `OfficePet`
- `PetToy`

and that there is a way to retrieve them from the API. For example, you can
call [http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/v1/persons](http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/v1/persons) to get all available instances
of `Person`.

## Create a derivation graph

From this toy example it can be easily read how the entities are related.

- Without any information we get all `Person`.
- From `Person` we can then get all `Computer`.
- From `Person` we can then get all `Project`.
- Without any information we get all `OfficePet`.
- From `OfficePet` we can then get all `PetToy`.

The **root**-Node marks the start. This would be a graphical representation of the structure we described just now.

![Derivation Tree for the toy example](img/derivation_tree_client.svg "Derivation Tree")

## Create a Client

Next we need to create a client which can get us the data from the API. This has already been prepared for you. Now you
should open your IDE of choice with the Sample API Client project.

NOTE: We split a client into two parts. An API and the actual implementation. This is primarily being done for inversion
of control, so a consumer (such as the Connector) can rely on the API, and only requires the actual Client
implementation at runtime.


![](img/client-project-setup-00.png)

In the client-api are the models and the interfaces which specify the client fragments. In this case the client is split
into two parts. One for the person another for the office pet.

![](img/client-project-setup-01.png)

The models are identical to what the API provides us. This is because feign can thereby parse with jackson the returned
values.

The client then contains the actual implementation of the client fragments. As you can see in the next image, the
clients are separated into the implementation of the interfaces and a feign resources. This is to keep everything small
and manageable.

![](img/client-project-setup-02.png)

In the end is the `SampleApiClient` a facade (delegation of the client fragments).

To now actually use this client you firstly need to run the docker container with the API. Next you need to add in
your `~/.gradle/gradle.properties` the following line:

```
datalbry.sample.api.uri=http://127.0.0.1:8000/
```

First the gradle build script sets an environment variable from this property. This is because the configuration
requires of the client needs to know the URI of the API. If you choose a different port for the Sample API you can have
to adjust the port here accordingly.

In the test is a sample usage of the client. You can find the test
in `client/src/test/kotlin/io/datalbry/sample/api/client/feign/SampleApiClientTest.kt`.

![](img/client-project-setup-03.png)

If you now start the test, it should pass.

## Create A Connector

In DataLbry's Connector SDK a connector consists of multiple processors. A processor is something that processes an edge
and produces new nodes. From the previous tree a processor would take the root-node, process it and create a new node,
like the for example `Person`. You define for every edge a processor in your graph.

This section will also utilize the already implemented project. Now you should open the sample api connector in the IDE
of your choice.

### Building Blocks

The connector project usually is build by the following 5 blocks:

- <dfn>Processors</dfn>: Explained previously.
- <dfn>Document</dfn>: A Document is a searchable Record which has to have a globally unique identifier. Even amongst
  documents of different types.
- <dfn>Record</dfn>: A Record is a specifically annotated class which then can be stored in the backend.
- <dfn>ContainerNode</dfn>: A container node is a collection of nodes containing the keys for other documents. Usually
  they are named something like `KeyNode` and the container containing them are called `KeyNodeContainer`.

You may add utility functions or anything else. But the previously described blocks are the main part of connectors.

### Diving Into The Connector

Next we are going to dive into the connector and explore it step by step. We will add one element after another it.

#### First Processor

First you should check out to the branch `00-first-processor-person-document`

```shell
$ git checkout 00-first-processor-person-document
```

When you open the project you should see the following project structure:

![](img/connector-project-00-01.png)

What you should notice here is that:

- `config` package contains the properties which will be loaded via Spring and a connector config which will get the
properties passed via dependency injection. This one expects

![](img/connector-project-00-02.png)

- `extensions` package contains extension functions of all sorts. Here we convert back and forth as we needed from the
client to the Documents/Records/KeyNodes

- `model` package contains all the model classes

- the processors are just lying in the `io.datalbry.sample.api.connector`

How do we come from the client api to the KeyNodes, KeyNodeContainer and such?

![](img/connector-project-00-03.png)
![](img/connector-project-00-04.png)

The `PersonKeyNodeContainer` contains the `PersonKeyNode`s, and they are annotated with `@Children`. This way we tell
the Connector SDK to give them to a processor and process them. In this case you see a collection of the KeyNodes but,
you can also just have one single KeyNode here. More on that later. For now the Connector SDK will start a
`PersonKeyNodeToPersonDocumentProcessor` for every `PersonKeyNode` in this container.

To sum it up, we have two processors:

- `RootToPersonKeyNodeCollectionProcessor`, from the naming schema you can conclude that this processor starts from the
root node and produces a `PersonKeyNodeContainer`. It should be `Container` and not `Collection`.
- `PersonKeyNodeToPersonDocumentProcessor`, which takes a `PersonKeyNode` and produces a `PersonDocument`.

Both of them basically wrap the client and convert the objects. You can take a look.

This results at this step into the following derivation tree:

![](img/connector-project-00-derivation-tree.svg)

Before we continue it is good to mention testing right now. You should always of course test your code. Next we are
going to go through very simple integration tests which will basically verify the functionality.

- `src/test/kotlin/io/datalbry/sample/api/connector/extension/SampleApiConnectorTestExtension.kt`
- `src/test/kotlin/io/datalbry/sample/api/connector/SampleApiConnectorTest.kt`

Let's start with `SampleApiConnectorTestExtension`. This just set's the properties from the environment and is loaded
by `SampleApiConnectorTest`.

![](img/connector-project-00-05.png)

Next is the actual test.

![](img/connector-project-00-06.png)

1. This is setting up a docker container for data persistence
2. Here we use the previous extension
3. The path to the datasource. This is in this case set by the `ConnectorTestExtension`
4. The data persistence client `Alxndria`
5. The connector engine basically
6. You **HAVE TO REGISTER ALL DOCUMENTS AND RECORDS** here. Everything you want to persist into the backend has to be
registered here!
7. Registering the data source at the given datasource identifier and the schemas.
8. Start the connector (propagating through the tree)
9. The propagation happens in the backend right now with an AMPQ channel. This is why we wait here. `awaitConvergence`
waits for the number of elements (given by `await`) and checks every `steps` seconds if the size of the datasource
does not change.
10. Then the test are run. Here we perform some test with this utility function.

![](img/connector-project-00-07.png)

This utility function fetches does:

- fetches all documents of the given type `DocumentType`
- checks if not empty
- checks if there is a document which contains the expected fields

#### Second Layer

For this part please check out at the branch `01-processing-second-layer-documents`

```shell
$ git checkout 01-processing-second-layer-documents
```

Now we are going to extend the connector and add documents which are deeper inside the API. Documents which are more or
less indirectly reachable. This means we will have more processors. So let's see what has been added.

![](img/connector-project-01-01.png)

Following has been added:

- Document, KeyNode and KeyNodeContainer about the Computer
- ProjectDocument and ProjectInformationRecord about the Project
- Extension functions to transform them
- Three new processors.

To remind you why there is no KeyNode and KeyNodeContainer for the Project: The API didn't offer us anything to access
it like this. So here the connector just fetches the list of Projects as the API provides us. Hence, we just take the
`PersonKeyNode` and produce a collection of `ProjectDocument`s.

Additionally, the tests have been extended accordingly.

Lastly the derivation tree at this step looks like this:

![](img/connector-project-01-derivation-tree.svg)

#### Last Branch From Root

Lastly we have to cover the remaining part from the root node. For this part please check out at the
branch `02-processing-office-pets`

```shell
$ git checkout 02-processing-office-pets
```

This part of the documentation covers a case where we can retrieve a collection of documents. We don't have a
possibility to get them by their id. Hence, we can't first get the KeyNodeCollection, then the KeyNode and lastly the
Document itself. In the case of the OfficePetDocument we will proceed as follows. The OfficePetDocument looks like this:

![](img/connector-project-02-01.png)

In this particular case we will include the KeyNode into the Document. The Connector SDK knows by the `@Children`
annotation that this value should be passed to another processor. Additionally, the `@Exclude` annotation prevents this
attribute to persist into the final schema. Meaning that the `keyNode` will not appear in the database.
