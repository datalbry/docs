The ****DataLbry Knowledge Cloud*** is a knowledge management cloud, providing various standard integrations and various tools to analyse and access the knowledge, which is hidden inside your companies data.

## Modules

The Knowledge Cloud consists of different modules providing support for different aspects of your knowledge management. 
But everything starts with the most important part. Integrations

### Integrations

The Knowledge Cloud Integrations helps you to quickly access your knowledge in your Knowledge Cloud.
Most knowledge lies hidden in the data of your company and just waits to be picked up. 
Unfortunatley it is a error-prone and hard way to integrate services by yourself. 
For that reason DataLbry helps you to integrate your systems as easy as possible, so you can access the Knowledge in minutes, not in months!
There mainly four different ways to index data into the knowledge cloud:

1. Pre-built Connectors
3. Deploy a custom Connector
4. External Connector

#### Pre-Built Connecors

DataLbry already provides various pre-built connectors, which are already ready for you to use. 
You can simply configure pre-built connectors and they are going to start integrating the data. 

:::note
DataLbry doesn't provide a custom Connector for your desired system? Let us know!
:::

#### Deploy a custom Connector

DataLbry provides a Java SDK helping you to easily write a custom integration, 
if we not already provide a custom integration for the system. 

#### External Connector

DataLbry does not enforce using our `Pre-Built Connectors` nor `Deploying a custom Connector`, you can simply built your very own connector and index the data into our `Indexing` module.

### Indexing

DataLbry requires access to data, so we can help you to access the knowledge hidden deep inside your data. 
For this reason the Knowledge Cloud provides the `Indexing Module`, making it easy to add custom `Datasources`. 

#### Structured Data

DataLbry is unique, as it requires data to be structured.

We enfore structured data, as most of the time only the direct developer, administrator or business owner of an system can tell you exactly what the data usually looks like. 
If one relies on unstructured, and primarily unknown data, it gets very hard, sometimes even nearly impossible to generate knowledge out of your data.

:::note
To improve help others to structure data easily, we developed a standard called `Precise`. 
`Precise` is being used for most of our services and helps us to structure the data more easily.
It's Open-Source, check it [out](https://github.com/datalbry/precise)!
